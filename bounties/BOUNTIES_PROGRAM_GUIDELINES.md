# Core Bounties Program Guidelines

## Proposing a Bounty Task

All new bounty tasks are discussed and submitted via GitHub.

### Ideation Phase

1. **Create a GitHub Issue**: Start by opening a new issue in the Core Bounties repository. Ensure you select the appropriate category for your task.
2. **Craft a Descriptive Title**: Give your GitHub issue a title that clearly reflects your proposal.
3. **Complete the Issue Details**: Fill out all required fields in the GitHub issue template and submit it for review.

### Review Phase

1. **Community Feedback**: Engage with the community to gather comments, discussions, and suggestions on your proposed bounty task. Community feedback helps highlight the taskâ€™s relevance.
2. **Committee Review**: The Core Bounties Committee will review the proposals. An issue will receive an "approved" label if it meets the criteria, or it may be closed if not.
3. **Approval and Assignment**: Once approved, the bounty task is ready for implementation but is not yet assigned to an executor.

## Taking on a Bounty Task and Completing It

1. **Plan and Collaborate**
   - **Select a Task**: Choose an approved bounty task from the list of unassigned tasks.
   - **Propose Your Plan**: Share your implementation strategy, suggested reward amount, and a proposed deadline.
   - **Provide References**: Include references that demonstrate your capability to execute the task effectively.

2. **Await Assignment**
   - **Task Assignment**: Wait for the Core Bounties Committee to assign the task to you.

## Submitting Bounty Deliverables

1. **Complete the Task**
   - **Execution**: Work on and complete the bounty task according to your proposed plan.

2. **Deliverables Submission**
   - **Submit Your Work**: Post a comment on the GitHub issue with a brief summary of your deliverables.
   - **Create a Pull Request**: Add a Pull Request to the Hall of Fame file, including your wallet address and a link to the specific bounty (e.g., Pull Request #136).

3. **Final Review and Rewards**
   - **Review Process**: Your deliverables will be assessed by community members and the Core Bounties Committee.
   - **Rewards**: Upon successful review, you will receive:
     - **Bounty Payment**: X$ in Core tokens
     - **Acknowledgement**: Your contribution will be noted for future roadmap additions and recognition.
