## Overview

## Core Bounties Program

The Core Bounties Program is centered around the following key areas, all aimed at advancing the Core Network’s integration within the BTCfi ecosystem and enhancing the EVM landscape for developers who seek the security of Bitcoin:

### 1. Developer and Community Tool Enhancements
Create and refine tools that empower developers within the Core community, emphasizing the development of dApps that leverage the security of Bitcoin and are compatible with the EVM ecosystem. This includes developing tools that simplify the development process, improve debugging capabilities, or provide enhanced analytics to optimize dApp performance on the Core Network.

### 2. Educational Content Development
Produce tutorials, guides, and other learning resources that help users and developers maximize their experience with the Core Network, contributing to both the BTCfi ecosystem and the broader EVM landscape. These educational materials should focus on enabling new developers to quickly grasp the fundamentals of building on Core, as well as advanced techniques for integrating Bitcoin’s security into EVM-compatible dApps.

### 3. Improving Documentation and Community Resources
Strengthen existing documentation and resources to ensure they are comprehensive, user-friendly, and aligned with the vision of integrating Bitcoin security with EVM-compatible development. This includes updating existing documentation, creating new resources that address emerging needs, and ensuring all content is accessible and easy to understand for developers at all levels.

### 4. Security Audits and Best Practices
Conduct in-depth security audits and propose best practices that enhance the security of the Core Network and its ecosystem. By identifying potential vulnerabilities and suggesting robust solutions, participants help maintain the high security standards expected of a network that leverages Bitcoin’s security. This category is crucial for ensuring that dApps and infrastructure built on Core are resilient against potential threats.

### 5. Core Ecosystem Expansion
Propose and develop new features, services, or integrations that expand the Core ecosystem, particularly those that align with the BTCfi vision of combining Bitcoin’s security with the flexibility of the EVM. This could involve introducing new financial instruments, cross-chain integrations, or services that make Core more attractive to developers and users within the broader crypto landscape.

### 6. Bug Bounties
Identify and report security vulnerabilities, bugs, or issues within the Core Network and its related tools, earning financial rewards for contributions that enhance the stability and security of the network. This initiative is integral to maintaining the integrity of the Core ecosystem, ensuring that developers and users alike can trust in the reliability and security of the platform.

Our mission is to drive innovation by ensuring that all contributions are in sync with the broader goals of the BTCfi ecosystem and the EVM landscape, empowering developers to build secure and scalable dApps on Core. Through this program, we aim to foster a community of developers and contributors who are committed to advancing the Core Network, leveraging the unmatched security of Bitcoin, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.


## How to Participate

There are two primary ways to get involved in the Core Bounties Program:

### 1. Complete a Bounty Task

Browse the list of available bounty tasks that are ready for execution. These tasks are defined by the community and Core Network contributors. By successfully completing a task, you’ll earn a reward that reflects the value of your contribution, especially if it advances BTCfi-related initiatives or enhances the EVM landscape.

### 2. Suggest a Bounty Task

Have an idea that could benefit the Core Network, the BTCfi ecosystem, or the EVM landscape? [You can propose your own bounty task](https://github.com/Camnaz/core-bounties/issues/new/choose)! If the community sees its potential, we’ll pair it with someone capable of executing it. Once the task is completed, funding will be provided, and the contributor who brought the idea to fruition will be rewarded.

## ⚠️ Note on Dev Tooling Category

We particularly encourage contributions to the development of smart contracts and tools that have broad applicability within the BTCfi ecosystem and the EVM landscape. These contributions should prioritize the security and scalability afforded by Bitcoin while being reusable by multiple teams and developers. Such contributions are eligible for the Dev Tooling category and may receive additional support and recognition due to their widespread impact.

## Core Legends Initiative

At Core Network, we recognize the importance of consistent, high-quality contributions. To ensure that these key contributors receive appropriate recognition, we’ve established the **Core Legends Initiative**. This initiative honors and rewards those who have made significant and enduring contributions to the network, particularly those who have helped align Core with the BTCfi ecosystem and the EVM landscape.

The **Core Legends Initiative** offers special incentives and historical recognition to those whose efforts have had a major impact on the Core ecosystem, enhancing its integration with Bitcoin’s security and the EVM framework. It’s our way of ensuring that the most valuable contributors are celebrated and appropriately rewarded.
